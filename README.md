## Browser Compatibility

This app works best in modern browsers that support the MediaDevices API. For the best experience, use:

- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Microsoft Edge (latest)

## Privacy Note

This application processes all camera data locally in your browser. No images or video data are sent to any server.

## Running Locally with a Server

For the best experience, especially on some browsers that restrict camera access on local files, you might want to run this with a simple HTTP server:

Using Python:
```
# Python 3
python -m http.server

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
